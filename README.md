# Comparitive-Analysis-of-Algorithms-for-Sports-Image-Classification
This project aims to perform a comparitive analysis of  Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for sports image classification.Through evaluation of accuracy, precision, recall, feature selection and computational efficiency, identified the most effective algorithms,
providing valuable insights for enhancing automated sports image classification in applications such as sports analytics and content tagging.

## Description
Sports image classification is an important task in various domains, including sports analysis and content organization. In this project, we will implement and compare multiple algorithms to determine their performance in accurately classifying sports images. By comparing their strengths and weaknesses, we aim to identify the most effective algorithms for different sports-related tasks.
